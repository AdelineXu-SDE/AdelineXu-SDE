👋 Hi, I'm Adeline Xu

AI Engineer / Backend Engineer  
Agentic Systems • LLM Orchestration • Scalable Backend

📍 Calgary, Canada


### About Me

I'm a software engineer with 3+ years of experience in backend systems and cloud infrastructure, currently focused on building **agent-based AI systems** that combine LLM orchestration, tool-use, and production-grade execution.

My work focuses on:
- **Agent architectures** (orchestrator–subagent workflows)
- **Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** with structured metadata filtering
- **Reliable execution** (checkpointing, isolation, reproducibility)

I enjoy turning complex, open-ended problems into **controlled, auditable, and scalable AI systems**.


### Tech Stack

**Languages**  
Python, Java, SQL

**AI / Agent Systems**  
LangGraph, DeepAgents, Hybrid RAG (Dense + Sparse), Tool-augmented LLMs, Function Calling

**Backend & Infra**  
Spring Boot, Kafka, Redis, MySQL, SQLite  
AWS (EC2, S3), Docker, Git, Linux
