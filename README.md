📌 About Me

I'm a software engineer with 3+ years of experience in backend systems and cloud infrastructure, currently focused on building **agent-based AI systems** that combine LLM orchestration, tool-use, and production-grade execution.

I work at the intersection of:
- **Agent architectures** (orchestrator–subagent workflows)
- **Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** with structured filtering
- **Reliable execution** (checkpointing, isolation, reproducibility)

I enjoy turning complex, open-ended problems into **controlled, auditable, and scalable AI systems**.
